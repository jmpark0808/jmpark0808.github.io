Hi! My name is Jinman (Eddie) Park. I'm a doctoral student in Systems Design Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Paul Fieguth and Prof. David Clausi. My thesis work is on superpixel salient object detection supported by Microsoft Office Media Group to perceive images in an abstract way. I'm also involved with various other research areas such as egocentric pose estimation, unsupervised domain adaptation, and sea ice classification.
